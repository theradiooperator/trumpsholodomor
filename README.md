# [This is Trump's Holodomor](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).

## ["A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/) — attributed to Joseph Stalin

## ["I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/donald-trump-fifth-avenue-comment/) — Donald J. Trump

## ["When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases."](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/15/21259888/trump-coronavirus-testing-very-few-cases) — Donald J. Trump 

We do not believe we are trivialising the mass starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Stalin, nor does it matter that Stalin might not have said the above. (If the argument that the Stalin quote at least captures sentiment he actually expressed is true, it makes the Trump quotes even more telling.)

Our calling the Holodomor into mind is not meant as a strict comparison of severity or even of the exact crime. It is to recognize the cold, sociopathic, Death-Cult-like narcissism of Trump, the cult of personality surrounding him, and the disinformation spewing so blatantly from the highest office. It is to note that we, humanity, have seen this before. 

This is a person, and a political dynamic (read: nearly entirely contrived, something else is possible as soon as the people in charge want it to be), which is killing at a large scale while seemingly being ignored or denied by those most responsible for inaction. Others with power throw up their hands and make all the right noises, yet somehow do little. They are not willing to throw their political bodies on the line. 

It is our sense (echoing so many others') that it is dangerous enough that we have a willfully ignorant response to a pandemic on its way to killing hundreds of thousands of people in the United States who did not need to die. We ought to be able to learn from the past from *before* these tragedies become a more apt comparison.

Either Donnie *is* out of his league or he *doesn't care*. What is the excuse for leaving him in power? We see his lack of leadership as crimnal, with so many more are culpable, across the parties, because they will not stop him. 

There are many plausible excuses and interesting analyses about this dynamic; they are not sufficient to erase culpability. This crippled ability to mitigate disaster is not so unlike the worst of Sovietism. (Let's not give it the honor of being called communism, just as the United States doesn't literally much resemble a free market capitalist society.)
