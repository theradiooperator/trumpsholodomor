### WTF?

No, we are not trivialising the mass starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Stalin. And no, it doesn't matter that Stalin may very well not have said the above. The comparison is not a strict comparison of severity or even of the exact crime. 

It is of death-cult-like narcissism that puts so many not just at risk, but in fact kills while being ignored or denied by the narcissist in question. It is to suggest there's *something* akin here, that we can learn from the past from *before* it becomes a 1-to-1 or apples-to-apples comparison.

It is to broadcast our sense that we already have a willfully ignorant response to a pandemic on its way to killing hundreds of thousands of people in the United States who did not need to die.

Either Donnie is out of his league or he doesn't care.

We see his lack of leadership as crimnal, but so many more are culpable, across the parties, because they will not stop him. There are many plausible excuses and interesting analyses about this dynamic, they are not sufficient to erase culpability. This crippled ability to mitigate disaster is not so unlike the worst of Sovietism. (Let's not give it the honor of being called communism, just as the United States doesn't really resemble a free market.)
