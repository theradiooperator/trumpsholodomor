### WTF?

No, we are not trivialising the mass starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Stalin. And no, it doesn't matter that Stalin may very well not have said the above. The comparison is not a strict comparison of scarcity. It is of death-cult-like narcissism that puts so many at risk. It is to suggest there's  *something* akin here worth learning from *before* it becomes a 1-to-1 or apples-to-apple comparison.

It is to broadcast we see meglomania from a mile away, and while we don't need a willfully ignorant (at best) famine to see it, we already have a willfully ignorant response to a pandemic on its way to killing hundreds of thousands of people who did not need to die.

Either Donnie is out of his league or he doesn't care.

And so many more are culpable, across the parties, because they will not stop him.
